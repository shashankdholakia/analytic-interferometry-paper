abstract = {Regularization is a general method for solving ill-posed and ill-conditioned problems. Traditionally, ill-conditioning in system identification problems is approached using regularization methods such as ridge regression and principal component regression. In this work it is argued that the Tikhonov regularization method is a powerful alternative for regularization of nonlinear system identification problems by introducing smoothness of the model as a prior. Its properties is discussed in terms of an analysis of bias and variance, and illustrated by a semirealistic simulation example.}
